Software Security

<ins>**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**</ins> <br><br>
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They were seeking my help to protect their client's data and financial information by implementing a file verification system to their existing web application. 

<ins>**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**</ins> <br><br>
I felt I found vulnerabilities particularly well during manual code reviews. It is vital to code securely so one does not open up additional attack vectors for malicious parties to abuse. Software security adds safety and protection to a company's data and its systems. It also saves them time and money by preventing attacks, two things any company is in short supply of.

<ins>**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**</ins> <br><br>
Breaking the vulnerability assessment into smaller more manageable parts was most helpful to me. The Vulnerability Assessment Process Flowchart was especially helpful with this.

<ins>**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**</ins> <br><br>
I started with the most vulnerable areas of the client's program and worked my way down from there, increasing the layers of security with each step. In the future, I will utilize online CVE databases to assess vulnerabilities and find mitigation techniques.

<ins>**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**</ins> <br><br>
Utilizing the right testing methodologies for my project is the first step. Unit testing and integration testing are vital components of any project. Adhering to secure coding principles to avoid common vulnerabilities and errors is another great step. Validating inputs and encrypting sensitive data goes a long way. Even simple things like keeping your code clear, and well-commented, and utilizing white space can improve functionality and security. This also makes code reviews that much easier. You must review your code for anything that might hinder functionality or security. Regression testing and re-running the dependency check is the best way to ensure you do not introduce new vulnerabilities. Re-running previous test cases will ensure the new code did not break anything or introduce new problems, and the dependency check will check if any of the new dependencies you may have added are vulnerable. 

<ins>**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**</ins> <br><br>
The Maven Dependency Checker and the vulnerability assessment process flowchart were very helpful and I will use them again.

<ins>**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**</ins> <br><br>
I would show my experience with the Maven dependency checker to show I can find vulnerabilities in a project.
